          I'm a computer engineering student and I have always been fascinated by technology. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, hiking, and reading. I took up computer engineering because I wanted to create technology that can make a positive impact on people's lives. In five years, I see myself working in the tech industry and continuously learning new skills to stay ahead of the curve.
